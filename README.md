# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis

This project involves the development of an interactive Power BI dashboard for visualizing and analyzing Airline passenger satisfaction data. 
The dashboard provides insights into passenger demographics, travel preferences, and satisfaction ratings based on various aspects of the airline's services, including cleanliness, leg-room, entertainment, and customer service.

### Dashboard Features

The dashboard contains the following key visualizations:

- Total Passenger Count: Displays the total number of passengers (130K), with a breakdown by gender (64K males, 66K females).
- Type of Travel: Shows the number of passengers traveling for business (90K) versus personal (40K) reasons.
- Age-wise Distribution: Categorizes passengers based on age groups, including middle-aged adults (47K), young adults (38K), seniors (34K), teenagers (7K), and children (4K).
- Satisfaction Levels: Segments passengers into those satisfied (56K) and those neutral/dissatisfied (73K).
- Customer Type: Displays whether passengers are returning or first-time flyers, with insights into gender and travel type (business vs personal).
- Ratings: Shows ratings for various service aspects, including cleanliness (3.3), legroom (3.4), on-board service (3.4), food & drink (3.2), entertainment (3.4), and baggage handling (3.6).
- Delay Information: Provides data on departure and arrival delay ratings, showing how passengers perceive punctuality (3.2 and 3.6, respectively).
- Interactive Filters: Enables users to slice data by gender, type of travel, and customer type to explore detailed insights.

### Tools and Technologies
- Power BI: Used to create and visualize the dashboard with interactive data insights.
- Dataset: Passenger satisfaction data, including demographic details, travel preferences, and service satisfaction ratings.

### Key Insights
- Business Travel Dominance: A higher number of passengers travel for business (90K) compared to personal reasons (40K).
- Age Group Trends: Middle-aged adults represent the largest group of passengers (47K), followed by young adults (38K).
- Neutral/Dissatisfied Majority: A significant number of passengers (73K) were neutral or dissatisfied with the airline services.
- Balanced Gender Representation: The data reveals a relatively balanced split between male and female passengers, with female passengers slightly outnumbering male passengers.

### Areas of Improvement
- Online Booking Experience: The lowest average rating across all services was for the online booking process (2.8/5), suggesting that passengers find it less satisfactory compared to other services like arrival delay (3.6) and on-board service (3.4). Emirates Airline should consider improving its online booking interface, streamlining the process, and addressing potential user experience issues.
- Food & Drink Quality: Another area where Emirates can improve is food and drink services, which received a lower average rating of 3.2/5. Enhancing the quality and variety of food options could improve customer satisfaction.

### How to Use the Dashboard
- Explore Data: Interact with filters on the dashboard to explore how passenger satisfaction varies based on gender, age, travel type, and other factors.
- Analyze Service Ratings: Examine the satisfaction ratings for key service areas, such as cleanliness, legroom, food & drink, and entertainment.
- Understand Customer Behavior: Gain insights into the differences between first-time and returning customers in terms of satisfaction and travel preferences.

### Conclusion

This Power BI dashboard offers valuable insights into the factors affecting passenger satisfaction for Emirates Airline. 
By leveraging these insights, airlines can identify areas for service improvement particularly in the online booking process and food services and target specific passenger segments to enhance overall satisfaction.
